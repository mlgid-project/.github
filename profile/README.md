# mlgid-project

## A comprehensive modern toolbox for grazing-incidence diffraction (GID)

</p>

This project aims to implement a comprehensive set of tools for the standardization and automation of GID data processing. The packages can be used separately or combined together in the pipeline. 



> As a convention, packages that rely on machine learning start with `ml`, while other packages (such as those for conversion to reciprocal space and conventional peak fitting) start with `py`.

# Available packages

## [pygid](https://github.com/mlgid-project/pygid) - converts raw GID data to reciprocal space.

## [mlgidGUI](https://github.com/mlgid-project/mlgidGUI) - provides graphical user interface for annotating GID data.

## [pygidSIM](https://github.com/mlgid-project/pygidSIM) - simulates synthetic GID data from crystal structures.
